# ParcelShop Worlds Team's Tools

This repo is meant to centralize and version Scripts and custom tools that are way far from our product core but can still be usefull or save the team some time.

Exs.:
- automation of repetitive point&click/copy+paste tasks;
- workstation configuration;
- de facto operationalization of tasks;
- ...

Every directory should have its own 'README' file explaining its purpose, usage and whatever needed.

If it is the first time for you about this entire repo notice that the "settler" project may help you setup everything.
