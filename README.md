# bash_utils

Some usefull functions, variables, configurations and tests/example to re-use in other scripts.
This repo is meant to centralize and version tools, scripts, function, variables, configurations, defaults, etc. so that I can easily reuse them latter.

If it is the first time for you about this entire repo notice that the "settler" project may help you setup everything.


Notice that the repo is divided into two major directories: "tools" and "libs"
