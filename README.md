# ParcelShop Tools

This repo is meant to contain Scripts and tools that are way far from our product core but can still be usefull or save the team some time.

Exs.:
- automation of repetitive copy+paste tasks;
- workstation configuration;
- ...

Every directory should have its own 'README' file explaining its purpose, usage and whatever needed.
