Setup the tools in this repository.

This project is a deployer(/manager) that helps you setup(/add/remove) the other projects in this repo.

It will create a directory in a place of your desire (with a default). That directory will contain two subdirectories: (i) one that will be referenced in your path and will containing scripts to be ran an (ii) another containing links to files that will be loaded right after your profile.

To add the directory to your path and to load the files this tool will use your "profile file" (.bashrc, .zshrc, .profile, ...).
